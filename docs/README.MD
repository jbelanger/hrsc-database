### SSDT

A quick overview about SSDT:

> A SSDT (SQL Server Data Tools) project in Visual Studio is a development environment for creating and managing SQL Server databases. It offers tools for schema definition, data management, deployment, and debugging. You can organize and version control database objects, compare and synchronize schemas, and easily deploy databases to different environments.

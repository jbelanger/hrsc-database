# Importing the HRSC Database into the SSDT Project

## Overview
The purpose of this document is to provide technical instructions on importing the HRSC database into an SSDT (SQL Server Data Tools) project. This process allows for efficient management, version control, and streamlined development of the HRSC database schema. 

## Prerequisites
- Visual Studio with SSDT installed
- Access to the HRSC database
- Connection details for the HRSC database (server name, authentication method, username, and password)

## Import Process
1. Launch Visual Studio and open the SSDT project where you want to import the HRSC database.
2. Right-click on the project in the Solution Explorer and select "Import" from the context menu.
3. In the "Import Database" dialog, choose the "Database" option.
4. Provide the connection details for the HRSC database, including the server name, authentication method, username, and password.
5. Click the "Connect" button to establish a connection to the HRSC database.
6. Once connected, a list of available databases will be displayed. Select the HRSC database from the list.
7. Customize the import options based on project requirements, if needed.
8. Click the "Finish" button to initiate the import process.

## Result
Upon completion of the import process, SSDT will analyze the HRSC database schema and generate SQL script files within the SSDT project. Each database object, such as tables, views, stored procedures, and more, will have a corresponding script file. This structure enables efficient management and version control of the HRSC database schema as part of the project.

## Benefits
1. Version Control: By incorporating the HRSC database into the SSDT project, we gain control over the database's source code, allowing us to track and manage changes effectively.
2. Collaboration: With the database schema stored as script files, team members can collaborate seamlessly, facilitating teamwork and reducing conflicts.
3. Deployment: Having the HRSC database as an SSDT project enables streamlined deployments, ensuring consistency and reliability across different environments.

## Conclusion
By importing the HRSC database into the SSDT project, we enhance our development process by centralizing database schema management, version control, and deployment. This technical documentation provides the necessary instructions to successfully import the HRSC database into the SSDT project, empowering our team to effectively work with and develop the HRSC database.
